This folder will be used as a playground while developing new azureQueue, azureTable, and azureBlob JS files.

plan is to start with the azureQueue.js file and follow the migration guide on the github repo.

so start with a copy, then change it up, logic by logic...
    -- use a copy of my ./_nodeApp/app.js file to test out the logic in my new azureQueue.js file
